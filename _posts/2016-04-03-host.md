# Host

"Host" is an audio piece/musical composition created by Mark Kingsley for the special edition of The Alternative Pick. Noted composer Mikel Rouse was the producer and sound engineer, and Paul Shipper's bass voice was the source material. The piece was presented as a sound installation in multiple. 

Notes for the piece named Erik Satie's _Musique d'ameublement_ & _Vexations,_ Luigi Russolo's _Intonarumori_, La Monte Young's _Dream House_ and Steve Reich's tape loops as spiritual antecedents. 

Mr. Shipper sang 43 notes; which were then sampled, combined into a seven-chord sequence, and then time expanded so each chord was two minutes long. The result was then looped and given a 20-minute fade at both beginning and end. 

This long fade was designed to take advantage of the "repeat" button on most commercial CD players. 

No suggestions on using the piece were offered, except to relay anecdotal reports that Morton Feldman fell asleep during performances of his work.
